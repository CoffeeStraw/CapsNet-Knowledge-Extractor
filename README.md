# CapsNet-Interactive-Visualizer
My Bachelor's Thesis. (TODO: Add project explanation)

## Running Locally
The project requires Python3 installed on your system.

Install the dependencies (TODO: Add pyenv commands):
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run a local server:
```
python3 run.py
```

Finally, navigate to [127.0.0.1:5000](https://127.0.0.1:5000).

Additionally, you can edit the Python CapsuleNetwork model or re-train the current one. For more informations about that, please check [`./capsnet_trainer/`](capsnet_trainer).
